* Really and truly, dealing with filenames is almost a science in itself.
* It's quite a jungle out there with so many conventions.
* has got to be one of th emain difference between the hardcopy and softcopy world (you have to have a filename at the eay in the latter)

I used a fixnames type base script written by Steve Oualline ages back. I was based on regularexpressions, which I subsequently made worse
by hardcoding specific regular expressions, but that's what throwaway scripts do .. promote hardcoding. That's why you WANT to throw them away afterwards.
so that's why this repsoitory came into being, I want to treat the subject more seriously.
